# My Project

## Overview

This project is an advanced web application built with modern technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Cloudinary, TypeScript, MongoDB, Axios, and Bcrypt. It is designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
- **Prisma**: An ORM for seamless database interactions.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service for managing images and videos.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for scalable storage solutions.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
- **Bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using Bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Image Management**: Upload and manage images with Cloudinary.
- **Database Integration**: Efficient data handling with Prisma and MongoDB.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and customizable interface.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Improved performance and SEO with Next.js.

## Setup and Installation

   DATABASE_URL="your-mongodb-connection-string"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret"
   CLOUDINARY_URL="your-cloudinary-url"
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
